# birbMathsBook


For @sableRaph's weekly Creative Coding Challenge. The Challenge topic was '90's Maths Book'.

Kind of a simple one, mainly wanted to get the blackboard thing to work and it kind of does.

- I'll be honest I don't remember what my maths textbook looked like.
- If I did I'd probably be better at maths.
- & skateboarding apparently.
- I think I'd like to be able to skateboard.
- actually might be too old for that now.
- what were we talking about again?

# Blender Bit.
- Nothing interesting going on here tbh.
- Baked three textures of varying quality that are maybe a bit 90's.

# P5 Bit!
- Look at me I wrote some P5!
- One of you, one of you!
- I mean I used it because it's easy to stick text on a canvas quickly with.
- Yes I know it's not performant to use a full library to do this, but tbh none of this is.
- 2 P5 canvases, one for the blackboard, one to stick sports emojis and random maths symbols on.


# Three Bit.
- Added those P5 canvases as textures to Three ShaderMaterial's
- Some Math.random() thrown into the shader material as a pretence of creativity.
- I mean I did some generative art.

# Shader bit.
- Little raymarching thing.
- Little  Koch curve thing that I don't really understand because it's maths.
- Added the emojis and symbols from the P5 Canvas.


#Other
- [Button is Josh Comeau's](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/animation/3d-button/)
- Needed a way to select and print random maths operators.
- Stored them as strings in an array and used an eval() but shhhhh!
- Seemed fine in the context of checking the sums worked?
- TBH being told to never use eval always makes me tempted to use the forbidden function.
